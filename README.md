# Cats n Dogs

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Get the following installed on your computer:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) for the Android SDK
* [Flutter](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/) as our framework

Let me know if you're having any issues with these. 
If you haven't done much work in the comand line Flutter might take a bit of extra time to get going

If you're on a mac you can either set up iOS or Android Emulation, but anything else you'll need to do Android. 

Then, if you haven't already, follow [the steps here](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/#vscode) to configure Visual Studio Code for Flutter.

Once this is all setup, you can clone this repo and open it in Visual Studio Code.

Take a look through the directories to the side. The lib directory is where our code sits (main.dart). 

Read through the comments in the code to get an idea what's going on.  

In VS Code it should allow you to hit F5 to start debugging in the simulator/emulator/actual device. 
You can choose which one to deploy to from the bottom right corner of VS Code.
